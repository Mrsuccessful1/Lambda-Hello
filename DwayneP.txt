Hello, my name is Dwayne. I am a new student here at Lambdaschool.

Intelligent
Trustworthy
Self-motivated

My favorite hobbies are learning. I like to be self sufficient, so 
I'm always looking at something new trying to better myself. I like 
to understand the methods behind different things and why they are the 
way they are.
