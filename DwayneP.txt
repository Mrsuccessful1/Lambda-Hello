Waddup, I'm D. Yea, I thought about changing my life for the better with some schooling, but I'm content.


Comfortable 
Stylishly lazy
procrastinator

If my favorite hobby were a sport, it would be call EXTREME COUCH-POTATO, or CP for short. 
I like having the confort of knowing that what I won't do, someone else will. 
All I have to do is apply my skills of being really really patient when I see a 
problem...and eventually someone will come in and fuss at me, but they'll make it right.

CP anyone?
