Waddup, I'm D. Yea, I thought about changing my life for the better with some schooling, but I'm content.


Comfortable 
Stylishly lazy
procrastinator

If my favorite hobby were a sport, it would be call EXTREME COUCH-POTATO, or CP for short. 
I like having the confort of knowing that what I won't do, someone else will. 
All I have to do is apply my skills of being really really patient when I see a 
problem...and eventually someone will come in and fuss at me, but they'll make it right.

CP anyone?


Oh, forgot to ask.....have you heard about the new snuggie with the pockets for a remote control, 
xbox controler, ps4 controler, built-in catheter and cup holders? Amazing right? pure genius!!!
Well, gotta go...this typing is cutting into my CP time.....
